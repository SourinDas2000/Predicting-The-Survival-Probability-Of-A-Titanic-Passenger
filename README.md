# About The Code
The program reads a CSV file containing all the passenger's information who were on board the Titanic on the day of the catastrophic event. The program creates a model using 'Random Forest Classifier' that reads the CSV file first and then could predict the surviving probability of six dummy passengers; that could be created based on passenger class, age, and sex. The output results are shown in form of a table along with the accuracy score of the model. The program aims to find any biases or regulations that may have been followed by the on-board staff that in the end had affected the fate of the passengers.
